# Traffic_Sign_Classifier_neural_network
Use TensorFlow to train a model so it can classify traffic signs from the German Traffic Sign Dataset

## Overview
In this project, I will use neural networks  to classify traffic signs. Namely,  use TensorFlow to train a model so it can classify traffic signs from the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, I will then test the model on a new images of traffic signs that I find on the web.

Dependencies
This project requires Python 3.5 and the following Python libraries installed:

Jupyter,
